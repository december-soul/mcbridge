* Overview
mcbridge is a multicast bridge, useful to bridge UDP multicast traffic between two machines over a TCP connection. This is sometimes needed because multicast routing is often not available over a WAN. 
* Usage
- On the machine that has access to multicast, that is the server machine:
#+BEGIN_SRC 
$ mcbridge server
#+END_SRC  - 
- On the machine that does not have access to multicast, that is the client machine:
#+BEGIN_SRC 
  $ mcbridge client -s <server address> -g multicast_ip:port ...
#+END_SRC
* Build
#+BEGIN_SRC 
$ git clone --recursive https://github.com/pedro-esteves-pinto/mcbridge.git
$ cd mcbridge
$ mkdir build && cd build && cmake .. 
$ make 
#+END_SRC  -
